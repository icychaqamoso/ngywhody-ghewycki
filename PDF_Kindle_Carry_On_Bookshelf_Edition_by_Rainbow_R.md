#1 New York Times best seller!
 Special bookshelf edition with a brand new case stamp and designed endpapers!

 Simon Snow is the worst Chosen One who&amp;#039;s ever been chosen.

 That&amp;#039;s what his roommate, Baz, says. And Baz might be evil and a vampire and a complete git, but he&amp;#039;s probably right.

 Half the time, Simon can&amp;#039;t even make his wand work, and the other half, he starts something on fire. His mentor&amp;#039;s avoiding him, his girlfriend broke up with him, and there&amp;#039;s a magic-eating monster running around, wearing Simon&amp;#039;s face. Baz would be having a field day with all this, if he were hereâ€”it&amp;#039;s their last year at the Watford School of Magicks, and Simon&amp;#039;s infuriating nemesis didn&amp;#039;t even bother to show up.

Carry On is a ghost story, a love story and a mystery. It has just as much kissing and talking as you&amp;#039;d expect from a Rainbow Rowell story - but far, far more monsters.
