Overview
Operative Dan Morgan is the ultimate force—an American hero weaponized for any contingency, his instincts honed to risk everything. Now you can read two heart-pounding Dan Morgan novellas in one electrifying volume.
 
 DARK TERRITORY
 Alex Morgan, daughter of CIA veteran Dan Morgan, is on a dangerous assignment outside Vladivostok, Russia, when she boards the Trans-Siberian Railway to make her escape. But she’s not the only passenger with a hidden agenda. Now Dan Morgan has an impossible choice to make. Either he saves his daughter before fighter jets blow up the train, or he stops a madman from annihilating the world. Either way, this train ride is a one-way ticket to World War III.
  
 DEEP COVER
 Agents Dan Morgan and Peter Conley successfully got themselves thrown into prison in Istanbul. Now comes the hard part of the mission: extract a scientist who masterminded Turkey’s new missile guidance system—without triggering a Middle East war. When an enemy from Morgan’s past threatens the operation, the two agents face a desperate fight for their lives, with the fate of two hemispheres hanging in the balance.
