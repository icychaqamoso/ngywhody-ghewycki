Overview
Straight from the roux bayou, a culinary memoir about how a centuries old Cajun and Creole secretâ€•gumboâ€•has become one of the worldâ€™s most beloved dishes. The product of a melting pot of culinary influences, gumbo reflects the diversity of the people who cooked it up: French aristocrats, West Africans in bondage, Cajun refugees, German settlers, Native Americansâ€•all had a hand in the pot. What is it about gumbo that continues to delight and nourish so many, in America and around the world?Â  A seasoned journalist, Ken Wells sleuths out the answers. His obsession goes back to his childhood in the Cajun bastion of Bayou Black, where his French-speaking motherâ€™s gumbo often got started with a chicken chased down in the yard. In Gumbo Life: A Journey Down the Roux Bayou, Wells shares his lifelong quest to explore gumboâ€™s roots and mysteries. He spends time with octogenarian chefs to make a gourmet gumbo; joins a team at a highly competitive gumbo contest; visits a factory that churns out gumbo by the ton; and observes the gumbo-making rituals of an iconic New Orleans restaurant where high-end Creole cooking and Cajun cuisine first merged. Gumbo Life, rendered in Wellsâ€™ affable prose, makes clear that gumbo is more than a dish: itâ€™s an attitude, a way of seeing the world. This is a tasty culinary memoirâ€•to be enjoyed like a simmering pot of gumbo. This edition includes recipe additions as well as a story about the authorâ€™s quest for authentic Cajun Dark Roux, which involved a hunt for (thankfully scarce) bear lard.
